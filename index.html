                <div class="text"><em>A soft, squishy ball of fluff with a mysterious past.</em>
                    Mochi was found napping in a ramen shop in Kyoto and hasn’t stopped eating since. Her favorite activity is loafing in sunbeams and judging your life choices. She’s got a PhD in Napping and a minor in Stealth Purring. Loves cardboard boxes and jazz music.</div>

                <div class="text"><em>A cloud with claws.</em>
                    Nimbus is a silver-gray Persian who looks like a storm but acts like sunshine. Born during a thunderstorm, he's convinced he controls the weather. Known for dramatic entrances and sleeping on freshly folded laundry, Nimbus enjoys watching rain and pretending to be aloof (but secretly loves cuddles).

                <div class="text"><em>Tiny paws, big dreams.</em>
                    Ziggy once tried to ride a Roomba into battle. A chaotic good tabby with a lightning bolt marking on his back, he was named after Ziggy Stardust for his love of nighttime zoomies. Favorite hobbies include knocking over water glasses and philosophizing at 3am.</div>

                <div class="text"><em>A spice, a menace, a legend.</em>
                    Peppercorn is a tuxedo cat with a villainous mustache and the attitude to match. Once tried to hack into a laptop by walking across it repeatedly. Has a soft spot for string cheese and hates cucumbers with a passion. Rumor has it, she once led a gang of alley cats in a daring fish heist.</div>
