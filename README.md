# odin-landing-page
In this project I created a simple landing page following the odin project's design using my fundamental knowledge of html, css, and flexbox. Doing this project I just didn't coast through it I also went back to review some knowledge and did some google search to figure out something. In the end I was able to replicate the design even though it is far from perfect I know there are alot of room for improvement on this project of mine like improving techniques and structuring the whole document. I did finish it no matter how not pretty the project is so that's good. I may improve this in the future if I ever get better.
